Hi everyone, my name is Valeria, I am 33 years old and I am junior front end developer.

I have master degree in Applied informatics in Economic and additional degree in web-design.
Besides that I have complied several courses, HTML, CSS and Javascript courses from Udemy and Pre-school from Rolling Scopes School.

I worked as logistic specialist in big Japanese company for last 7 years, but in 2022 I decided to change my live and restart my career for the scratch.

I chose front-end development for several reasons:

Firstly, front-end development allows me to combine my creativity and technical skills.
Being able to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces is incredibly fulfilling for me.

Secondly, front-end development is a rapidly evolving field. And I always will have to learn new technologies, frameworks, and best practices to learn, and all of these things keep the work dynamic and exciting. 

Additionally, front-end development offers a tangible sense of accomplishment. Seeing a website or application that I have contributed to come to life and being able to interact with it gives me a great sense of pride.

I choose Rolling Scopes School because this school have a great supporting community.

All materials is free and in very good structure. So everything depends on my motivation and my passion to learn.

My last pet project is Minesweeper. I think this project is the biggest one.
So I learned how to have deal with recursion, how to build JS modules and how to split big task to several small tasks.

And additional I would like to just say thank you everyone who have related to creation RS Scholl.
This is a grate place to learn and learning how to learn.

Thank you for always push me out of my comfort zone because in this case I learn mush faster.

I think that's all, thank you for everything and I really hope I will complete this course from this point until very very end. Thank you, bye!
